# Smart Low-Carbon Microgrid: Optimization of Dynamic Demand Response and Green Electricity Trading

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation for the project titled **"Wind-Farm-Power-Forecasting-Reconstruction-of-Wind-Farm-Feature-Data-and-Uncertainty-Assessment,"** developed as part of the **2025 CAE Internship Program**.


## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin using this repository for the first time:

1. Please refer to the **GitHub tools** section under *Other Resources*.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. All progress and development must be conducted **within this repository**.


## 🔄 Commit & Push Policy

- Regularly commit and push changes (recommended **daily**).
- Before each **weekly meeting**, you must:
  - Push your latest progress by **23:59 of the previous day**
  - Update the **progress report file** and your **weekly journal** (see the `weekly_meeting/` folder for reference)

## 🧑‍💻 Code
*To be developed. Below is the template.*

This project will include a modular and well-structured codebase, organized into the following components:

### 📁 Folder Structure (Planned)

```
src/
├── data_processing/       # Scripts for loading, cleaning, and transforming raw datasets
├── modeling/              # Optimization, forecasting, and simulation models
├── evaluation/            # Evaluation metrics and benchmarking tools
├── visualization/         # Plotting and visualization scripts
├── utils/                 # General-purpose helper functions
└── config/                # Configuration files (e.g., paths, parameters)
```

### 🧩 Planned Functional Modules

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Parsing Taipower and ERA5 data
  - Time alignment and gap filling
  - Aggregation to hourly resolution

- **Stochastic Optimization**
  - Demand-side response modeling
  - Green electricity trading with uncertainty handling

- **Evaluation**
  - Cost-benefit analysis
  - Emission impact estimation
  - Visual comparisons and dashboards

- **Visualization**
  - Load and generation trends
  - Flow maps and marginal emission heatmaps

> 📌 Each module will include example usage in `notebooks/` and be designed for reproducibility.
